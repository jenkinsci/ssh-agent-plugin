# SSH Agent Plugin

Thiss plugin allows you to provide SSH credentials to builds via a
ssh-agent in Jenkins.

This is convenient in some cases.
Alternately, you can use the generic `withCredentials` step to bind an SSH private key to a temporary file
and then pass that to commands that require it,
for example using the `-i` option to `ssh` or `scp`.

# Requirements

You need to have the `ssh-agent` executable installed on the agent.

# Configuring

First you need to add some SSH Credentials to your instance:

Jenkins \| Manage Jenkins \| Manage Credentials

Note that only Private Key based credentials can be used.

Then configure your build to use the credentials:

And then your build will have those credentials available, e.g.

From a Pipeline job, use the `sshagent` step.

# Jenkinsfile

```
      steps {
          sshagent(credentials: ['ssh-credentials-id']) {
            sh '''
                [ -d ~/.ssh ] || mkdir ~/.ssh && chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
                ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
                ssh user@example.com ...
            '''
          }
      }
```
